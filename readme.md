## Dolphin Service Menus

Servicemenus are defined using .desktop files, which are the same kind of files that are used to create entries in the K Menu or on the Plasma desktop. These servicemenu files are found in

ServiceMenus subfolder of one of the folders that can be determined with

    kf5-config --path services

In the case of my home machine that means that servicemenu files can be found in the following places:

    ~/.local/share/kservices5/ServiceMenus/
    /usr/share/kservices5/ServiceMenus/
